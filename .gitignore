# Include only favicon.ico in assets/favicon/
# ***********************************************************
# logic for only including a specific file/folder within a deeply nested subdirectory:
# 1) ignore everything inside the directory (e.g. /assets/*)
# 2) then un-ignore the direct child file/folder (!/assets/favicon/)
# repeat this process until you reach and un-ignore the desired file/folder. The key is that you can only un-ignore the direct child.
# directly un-ignoring the whole path to the desired file/folder will not work (e.g. !/assets/favicon/favicon.ico)
