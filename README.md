## About Vibewave

Vibewave is an app where you can listen to and share music & videos with your friends and the broader community.

- Any Vibewave user can create his/her own room where he/she will be the host
- Vibewave users can join any of the rooms available on Vibewave, and listen to the music/video selections played by the host together with other users in real time
- Inside a room, users can also interact with each other through chat, sharing their thoughts, ideas, etc.
- Users can also make song/video requests, which will show up on the 'Request Board', from which the host can choose to add to the room's playlist queue

### _If you love music and want to enjoy listening with your friends in real time, hop into Vibewave!_
